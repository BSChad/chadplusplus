Over the past year I have been participating in a cool little initiative / co-op / experiment called [Tiny Mass Games](http://www.tinymassgames.com). Every 2 - 3 months we try to develop and launch new games. The stars aligned for the second season of the program and I decided to do something insane: Do it entirely on my phone. I mostly succeeded and this is how.

This talk was presented at Boston Indies Lightning Talks. Presentations are limited to 10 minutes a piece and can cover a variety of topics.

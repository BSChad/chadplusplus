As with most likghtning talks I do, I thought of something dumb in the shower and built ten minutes around it. This time, it was a sight gag about the speed of pixels. I had a slightly different version of this talk prepared, but decided to move it towards how thinking of programming in terms of simulating reality can sometimes be a waste of time.

(I might have embellished the BioWare stuff from something I heard third hand from a designer.)

This talk was presented at Boston Indies Lightning Talks. Presentations are limited to 10 minutes a piece and can cover a variety of topics.
